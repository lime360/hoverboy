This is a concept demo of Hoverboy!

Made with very very outdated software called The Games Factory (by Clickteam and Europress)

Requirements:

Any Windows version that supports 32-bit apps is suitable for this

Controls:

Arrow Keys: Move

Space: Jump

R: Use hoverboard (Hoverboy) or Jetpack (Jetboy)

P.S. The finished game will be made in a very different and modern engine which means everything will differ from the concept demo.
